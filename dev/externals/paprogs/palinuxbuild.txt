palinuxbuild.txt:

Portaudio is required by the audio programs (paplay, pvplay, recsf, listaudevs).


The audio program CMake makefiles assume availability and use of both alsa and jack.

download the latest v19 stable release from: http://files.portaudio.com/download.html

To build, unpack pa--tgz in situ; this will create a portaudio directory. 

 
Run configure with these options:

./configure --with-alsa --with-jack

Then run make as usual to build, 

Do not perform 'make install' unless you are happy for it to replace your current system portaudio libs.

The CDP makefiles look for the local lib/.libs folder for libportaudio.a
