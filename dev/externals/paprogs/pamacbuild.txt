pamacbuild.txt:

Use this combination command to configure portaudio to build as a (single architecture) 
static library on OS X, required by the audio programs (paplay, pvplay, recsf, listaudevs).

The CDP programs build only for the 32bit architecture (-arch i386), 
as they have not yet been fully tested for correctness with a 64bit architecture.

Portaudio tends to assume all architectures are available, but this is not always the case 
from Xcode 4.x onwards (e.g. no ppc support).

You may need to edit the Makefile (or configure.in) by hand to add or exclude architectures. 

You will likely need to type the commands below directly, in Terminal. Cutting and pasting from a text
 editor (possibly using Unicode) may result in a config error.
 
On a 32bit OS type:

CFLAGS=$CFLAGS -mmacosx-version-min=10.4  ./configure --enable-shared=no --enable-mac-universal=no 

If building on a 64bit machine, omit --enable-mac-universal=no and  make sure to add -arch i386 
to the CFLAGS if not present, removing any which are not supported or needed, e.g:

CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -arch i386 -arch x86_64"

(the quotation marks are required if the CFLAGS string contains multiple options separated by spaces). 

Then run make as usual to build. 

The CDP makefiles look for the local lib/.libs folder for libportaudio.a
There is no need to run sudo make install

This is to avoid a couple of warnings when compiling pa_mac-core.c.
The macosx version setting is to prevent warnings  about deprecated APIs.
The configure script specifies -Werror ("treat warnings as errors"), 
which means that any such warning stops the build.

The command --enable-shared=no also seems to be needed, otherwise (for some reason) 
the linker fails to find the Pa_Util functions.

Newer builds of portaudio can of course be used; they may obviate some or all of the above issues; but may introduce new ones too!
