pamacbuild.txt 19-10-2021

This outlines the procedure to configure portaudio to build as a native static library on OS X,
required by the audio programs (paplay, pvplay, recsf, listaudevs). 
This assumes a full Xcode installation complete with all
required command-line tools.

Download the latest "stable" version of portaudio from: http://files.portaudio.com/download.html

This portaudio distribution only supports CMake for Windows platforms. 
To build for the Mac, follow the usual procedures based on autoconf. 

Portaudio by default tries to build for the earliest possible versions of MacOS (in theory, as far back as 10.4, say),
but modern installations of Xcode do not provide compatible versions of system libraries, so a build
specifying an early minimum version may fail with link errors. 
The configure flag --enable-mac-universal=no ensures portaudio is only built 
for the current native architecture, and for available recent OS versions.

Run ./configure as shown here - the CDP audio programs only require the static library, not dylibs.
 
./configure --enable-shared=no --enable-mac-universal=no

Then run make as usual to build. 

The CDP makefiles look for the local (to the CDP programs) lib/.libs folder for libportaudio.a
This procedure therefore does not replace any version of portaudio already installed in /usr folders.
