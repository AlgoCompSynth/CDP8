CDP Release 8 programs - core groups

[any programs not listed here fall into a general group of "misc" processing tools, some as background utility programs for Soundloom]


1. Synthesis.

General note: CDP hitherto has essentially limited pure synthesis processes 
to the generation of basic signals ("synth", "newsynth").

Release 8  introduces a number of new tools, all idiosyncratic one way and another,
extending to note and rudimentary score-based composition. 
We suggest they should all be regarded as R&D tools, maybe production of raw 
source material, rather than anything that would directly form or contribute to a
completed piece. However, for developers they may provide opportunities for 
custom adaptations and extensions.


 * clicknew:    make clicktrack using times listed in textfile.
 
 * multiosc:    FM-style chain of sines, four "operators". Limited envelope control.
 
 * multisynth:  Synthesize several sound-streams from a score. 
                Targetted at multichannel projects, but stereo also supported.
   
 * newscales:   Basic note generation using a fixed spectrum, no enveloping. 
                The program name suggests it is used for simple "scale" generation, 
                e.g. for experimental tunings.

 * newsynth:    Updated for R8, new mode "fractally arrayed spikes" 
               
 * pulser, Mode 3 "synth": generate wave-packets with fixed or varying spectrum.
 
 * synspline:   Synthesis from waveforms made by smoothly joining 
                randomly generated points.
                
 *  ts:         waveform generation/plot using time-series data, 
                as in "drawing" a waveform. Should this be called "Fairlight"?
                
 
 2.  Waveset distortion processes.
 
 * distcut:    Cut sound into elements (multiple outfiles) with falling envelope. 
 
 * distmark:   Interpolate between waveset groups.
 
 * distmore:   multiple new distortion processes. Mostly aimed at speech processing.
 
 * distrep:    waveset-based timestretching.
 
 * distshift:  literally, shift groups of half-wavecycles in time.
 
 ( * distwarp:  warp wavecycles. Not in Soundloom)
 
 * partition:   partition infile into multiple files by waveset blocks.
 
 * quirk:       raise samples to a power (<>1), based on wavecycles.
 
 * scramble:    scramble order of wavesets in infile. 14 processes.


 * splinter:	Creates splinters by repeating & shrinking selected waveset-group in sound.
		Either splinters repeat before merging with orig snd at time-in-src specified.
		OR original sound plays up to selected time, then splinters.

 3. Pvoc/amp/freq analysis/transformation tools. Several of these appear to be 
    primarily tools for Soundloom data display.
 
 * caltrain:    time-blur upper partials.
 
 * cubicspline: (datafile only): smooth amp/freq data points to make spectrum.
 

* specanal:     custom (complex) version of pvoc, generate data files, e.g. 
                    to visualise spectrum.
                
* specav:       average spectrum, output multiple spectrum datafiles.

* specenv:      spectral envelop transfer, probably like classic "pvcross".

* specfnu:      large complex progtam to process formants, spectral shape.

*specfold:      fold/invert/randomize part of the spectrum.

*spectstr:      time-stretching.

*spectune:      find and manipulate pitches in input file. 
                Options to map to pitch data in "tuning file".
                
*speculate:     permutations of channel data, creates large number of outfiles.

*suppress:      suppress most prominent partials in chosen freq band.


4. Multichannel tools. Primarily for discrete surround, e.g. 8 or even 16 chans. 
                        Many support simple stereo too.
                        
* brownian:     generate texture of [short} sampled elements, based on brownian motion.

* cascade:      segments of source repeat-echoed,a ccumulated. many options.

* crumble:      project mono source to all chans, plus segmentation etc. 
                Complex, output either 8 chans or 16 chans(!).
                
* crystal:      based on model of crystal ( regular polyhedron?), with 3d rotations.

* multisynth:   (see above), includes multichan options.

* onset:        find successive onsets in m/c file. May be utility for Soundloom.

* pairex:       extract arbitrary pair of chans from m/c file.

* pulser:       (see above) streams of pulses, some m/c options.

* repair:       join mono sounds into stereo/multichan outputs. so name = 're-pair".

* rotate:       generate list of x/y coordinates - for Soundloom?

* spin:         spin stereo image across m/c stage, usage msg a bit ambiguous, 
                seems to offer general n-chan options, 
                while also specifying stereo, quad, 5-chan.
                
*tesselate:     repeating and shifting patterns (in space, time). outchans >= 2.

*tremenv :      tremolo a sound, width narrowed, after peak.


5. Speech processing.

These explicitly reference syllables, etc, in their usage messages.

*distmore:      (see above) Mode USAGE msgs cite application to vowels/consonants. 

*envspeak:      Process speech "syllables".
                [NOT IN SOUNDLOOM]
                
*flatten:       equalise sound elements. Usage implies application to syllables etc.

* stutter:      slice source into elements (e.g. words or syllables).
