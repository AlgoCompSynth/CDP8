            [maybe not complete FM: usage shows time-variable freqs, but not amps - NEEDS CHECKING]
            [ also: danger of clipping - output is max amp always]
            [minimal in SOUNDLOOM, just recognised and in the list ]

phasor - [ quasi multichan] Introduce [mostly extreme] phasing into signal : Takes a MONO input file.
           will output multiple mono files, or mix to stereo (or whatever).

repair - [multichan] - Join a list of mono sounds into stereo, 4-channel or etc outputs.
            [seems to be used by Soundloom in "batch" processes, may not be represented directly in gui]

                        (except first - zeroed - window).
                     These can be used to run a "movie" of the data in Soundloom.
                     Modes 7-10 generate 1 textfile, a MIDI list, or a MIDI varibank filterdata file.
                     [implication: varibank data can be used to create a vocoder]
                     [COMPLEX? cmd users may find text data files intractable, 
                       better just to use standard pvoc for analysis]

specenv [pvoc]  -  Get the spectral envelope of file 2 and apply it to file 1.
                    Process equivalent to format extraction + formant impose/replace
                    but allows for larger spectral windows.
                    [so probably very similar to Csound "pvscross" etc]
                    
specfnu [pvoc] [23 modes] - Modify spectral shape in relation to formant peaks, or show formant data.
                    [COMPLEX - each mode elaborate, large no of flag options etc.]

                        5: Tune sound to a given (possibly time-varying) pedal pitch and its harmonics.

                        both actually offer n-channel options.
                        
splinter [4 modes] - Creates splinters by repeating & shrinking selected waveset-group in sound.
                    Either splinters repeat before merging with orig snd at time-in-src specified.

                            as the pitch-trace of some defined waveform [additive harmonic data].
